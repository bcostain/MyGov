# IST687 ‚Äì Exercise 6: Creating your own function
# Fall 2014
# Due October 19, 2014
#
# A key focus of Chapter 9 of ‚ÄúAn Introduction to Data Science,‚Äù is to introduce you to R-Studio ‚Äì an Integrated Development Environment or IDE.
# An IDE is like a factory: it is the place where you make stuff.
# In this case the stuff is code in the R language.
# One of the fundamental building blocks of code is the function.
# In languages other than R, a function is sometimes referred to as a subroutine, a procedure, or a method. Whatever the name of it may be, the goal is to provide a block of code that serves a purpose and can be reused. A function usually receives data inputs (parameters) and creates (returns) one data output (the data output may be a complex object with several different bits and pieces).
# In activity 5, you created a large population of random data using rnorm() and
# you also created a small sample of data using rnorm().
# The ‚Äúnorm‚Äù in rnorm() refers to the normal distribution, and the random data it generates fit into the normal distribution.
# For this activity what you need to do is create a function that
# 1a. creates a large number of samples of randomly generated data
# 1b. creates a large number of samples of normally distributed data,
# 2a. calculates the mean of randomly generated data,
# 2b. calculates the mean of normally distributed data,
# 3. saves all ofl the means in a list, and
# 4. returns the list.
# The inputs to your function should contain the following pieces of information:
#   INPUT1:  The number of samples in the sampling distribution (this will also be the length of the list returned by the function)
#   INPUT2:  The size/length of each sample
#   INPUT3:  The desired target mean of each sample
#   INPUT4:  The desired target standard deviation of each sample
#
# Here are the steps that will help you finish the job:
# 1.	In the R-Studio code window, start a new file to contain your function.
# 2.	Declare your function and name it ‚ÄúMyNormSampDist‚Äù.
# 3.	List out your the arguments based on the bulleted list of information shown above.
# 4.	Create the code for the function. You may find the replicate() function from Chapter 7 of the book very useful.
# 5.	Test the function by calling it with the following request:
#       hist(MyNormSampDist(1000, 25, 50, 10))
#       This test of your function assumes that we are asking for 1000 samples,
#       each with 25 observations,
#       where each sample has a mean of about 50 and
#       a standard deviation of about 10.
#       This command should produce a histogram centered on 50.
# 6.	If you have been following the ideas on the book about sampling theory,
#       it should be pretty clear to you that the histogram displayed by the command shown above
#       should have a pretty ‚Äúcompact‚Äù distribution
#       (i.e., with a standard deviation considerably smaller than 10).
#
# Learning Goals for this activity:
# A.	Create a function and understand the purpose of functions in programming. This understanding should include the concepts and use of input parameters and the concepts and use of returned data objects.
# B.	Create a sampling distribution of means in order to extend understanding of sampling theory and inferential statistics.
# C.	Extend skills for debugging and testing.
# D.	Increase familiarity with the purpose and concepts of IDEs in general and R-Studio in particular.

# IST687 ‚Äì Exercise 7: Manipulating SQL within R
# Fall 2014
# Due October 26, 2014
#
# Chapter 14, ‚ÄúStorage Wars,‚Äù describes a variety of ways in which R can connect to data sources.
# Given that SQL ‚Äì structured query language ‚Äì is one of the most fundamental and widely used tools for manipulating data, understand how to use SQL
# in the context of R is very important.
# One of the basic data building blocks in R is the data frame and this object bears a very strong resemblance to the concept of a table in SQL.
# In fact, there is a package in R called ‚Äúsqldf‚Äù that allows for the manipulation of a data frame as an SQL table.
# This feat is accomplished thanks to SQLite ( http://www.sqlite.org ), a fantastic, lightweight, open source implementation of SQL.
# Working with sqldf and SQLite is so convenient that under normal circumstances you can do your work completely within R,
# with no software installations needed on your computer (other than running the install.packages() command in R).
#  As we are about halfway through the course, this activity description does not provide the same level of code prompts as previous labs ‚Äì
# it is assumed that you remember or can lookup the necessary code.
# The overall goal of this activity is to use SQL to produce a subset of the built-in ‚Äúairquality‚Äù R dataset that contains only those records
# where the concentration of ozone is higher than the mean level of ozone.
#
# These are the conceptual steps you will need to follow:
# 1.  Review online documentation for sqldf so that you are familiar with the basic concepts and usage of the package and its commands.
# 2.    Install and activate (‚Äúlibrary()‚Äù) the sqldf package in R-Studio.
#         With any new package it is possible to run into installation issues depending on your platform and the versions of software you are running,
#          so monitor your diagnostic messages carefully.
# 3.	Make sure the built-in ‚Äúairquality‚Äù dataset is available for use in subsequent commands. It would be wise to reveal the first few records of airquality with head() to make sure that airquality is available. This will also show you the names of the columns of the airquality dataframe which you will need to use in SQL commands.
# 4.	Using sqldf(), run an SQL select command that calculates the average level of ozone across all records. Note that value down in a comment in your code file.
# 5.	Again using sqldf(), run another SQL command that selects all of the records from airquality where the value of Ozone is higher than the average. Note that it is possible to combine steps 4 and 5 into a single SQL command ‚Äì those who are familiar with SQL syntax and usage should attempt to do so.
# 6.	Refine Step 5 to write the result table into a new R data object called ‚ÄúnewAQ‚Äù. The run a command to reveal what type of object newAQ is, another command to show what its dimensions are (i.e., how many rows and columns), and a head() command to show the first few rows.
#
# Learning Goals for this activity:
# A.	Refresh or build knowledge of essential aspects of structured query language.
# B.	Understand the general aspects of the data architecture of R and how it is possible to run SQL commands ‚Äúnatively‚Äù in R.
# C.	Increase independent skills for finding solutions to software configuration issues.
# D.	Refresh and extend knowledge of the data frame object within R.
# E.	Increase familiarity with built-in datasets within R.
